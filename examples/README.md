 ## Requirements to build and run the examples

 You need java 17, Docker.

 Some examples also require MongoDB running on localhost.

 Install java it with [sdk](https://https://sdkman.io/)

 ```bash
 $ sdk install java 17.0.9-tem
 ```

The examples also uses maven, but this is available through `mwnw` (Maven wrapper), so there is no need to install it.

To easily run RESTHeart, you also need Docker.

To execute test requests, you need the http CLI command [httpie](https://httpie.io/cli).
